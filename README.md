Holding Ideas (o "hi") is my ultra-simple GTD personal for console (ToDoList y much more).
Write in python 3.x, the main goal is erase from my head all of things, tasks, ideas or similar..

### Some importants goals:
- *simple*
- Sort by subject o project, date, person.
- Use colors!
- In the future -> system to auto-reminders.

### Nota:
I like this project: http://todolist.site/. It's a good first point to start.

### Legends:
Notation:
 - '@' for persons
 - '#' for subject
 - '<>' for date
First argument:
 - '+' for add task
 - '-' for clean task
 - 'Ok' for check
 - 'ls' for list all.
